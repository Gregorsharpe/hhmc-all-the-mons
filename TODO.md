N.B. As you get into more complex mods, PLEASE check the keybinds for that mod to see if there's any you need to configure before asking me why it doesn't work!

Examples of working keybinds:
V - Voice chat settings
B - Backpack
M - Map
K - Cobblemon Summary
Z- Zoom

Move whitelist from folder root to MC root before launch.
